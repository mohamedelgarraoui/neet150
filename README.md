Every probleme should have the solution , a unit test and maybe explanation on how to get the solution without giving the straith answear, in case me or someone need a hint to solve this without getting the straith answear



the unit test bluerint
//import the function/class i want to test
// for exemple i'm working on the class Solution in my main.py i included like everything in python

from main import Solution

//the only thing interessting in the code bellow in the keyword 'assert', it's a python cmd that's allow us to tell the compiler that something ,some assertion is true
assert Solution(the input that the Solution should take) == (the output or conditon)

//or better using the lib pytest too (unstead of runing the app with pythin, we will run it with pytest)
jjjj
